## Key Concepts to Master

### Must-Know Differences

**Authentication vs. Authorization**
- Authentication = WHO you are (identity verification)
- Authorization = WHAT you can do (permission granting)

**Azure AD License Tiers**
- Free: Basic identity, SSO (10 apps)
- Premium P1: Conditional Access, hybrid features
- Premium P2: Identity Protection, PIM, Access Reviews

**MFA Methods (Strongest to Weakest)**
1. FIDO2 security keys (phishing-resistant)
2. Windows Hello for Business
3. Microsoft Authenticator (notification/passwordless)
4. Microsoft Authenticator (OTP code)
5. Third-party software tokens
6. SMS text message (weakest - avoid)

**Defender Products (What Each Protects)**
- Defender for Office 365 = Email & collaboration
- Defender for Endpoint = Devices/endpoints
- Defender for Identity = On-prem Active Directory
- Defender for Cloud Apps = Cloud applications (CASB)
- Defender for Cloud = Azure/hybrid/multi-cloud infrastructure

**Labels (Protect vs. Govern)**
- Sensitivity Label = PROTECT data (encryption, marking, access control)
- Retention Label = GOVERN data (how long to keep, when to delete)
- Both can be applied to same item

**Policies vs. Labels**
- Policy = Location-wide (all of Exchange, SharePoint, etc.)
- Label = Item-level (specific documents, emails)

**Records (Standard vs. Regulatory)**
- Record = Can't delete, limited edits
- Regulatory Record = Can't delete, can't edit, even admins can't remove label

**eDiscovery (Standard vs. Premium)**
- Standard = Cases, holds, searches, export
- Premium = + Custodians, analytics, predictive coding, review sets

**Audit (Standard vs. Premium)**
- Standard = 90 days retention
- Premium = 1 year default (up to 10 years), high-value events

**SIEM vs. SOAR**
- SIEM = Collect, analyze, detect (Sentinel analytics)
- SOAR = Orchestrate, automate, respond (Sentinel playbooks)
